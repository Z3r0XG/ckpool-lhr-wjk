# CKPOOL-LHR-WJK

A fork of CKPool-LHR adding Wojak Coin (WJK) SHA256d solo mining support,
with sub-"1" difficulty support for low hash rate miners (ESP32 devices and others).

Ultra low overhead, scalable, multi-process, multi-threaded WJK mining
pool software in C for Linux.

## Key Features

- Sub-"1" difficulty support for low hash rate miners
- Wojakcoind cookie authentication
- User agent whitelisting
- User agent reporting (pool.status and user pages)
- Network difficulty monitoring (pool.status)
- Worker connection timestamp tracking
- Configurable donation address
- Client configurable suggested difficulty via password field

## Acknowledgment

This software is a fork of CKPool by Con Kolivas. The original project is
provided free of charge under the GPLv3 license. We honor and acknowledge
Con Kolivas's foundational work that made this fork possible.

**Original project:** https://bitbucket.org/ckolivas/ckpool

## Design

**Architecture:**

- Multiprocess + multithreaded design to scale to massive deployments and capitalize on modern multicore/multithread CPU designs
- Minimal memory overhead and low-level hand-coded architecture for maximum efficiency
- Ultra-reliable Unix sockets for inter-process communication
- Modular code design to streamline further development
- Event-driven communication preventing slow clients from delaying low-latency ones

**Features:**

- Wojakcoind communication with multiple failover to local or remote locations
- Virtually seamless restarts for upgrades through socket handover
- Configurable custom coinbase signature
- Configurable instant starting and minimum difficulty (including sub-1.0 for low hashrate miners)
- Rapid vardiff adjustment with stable unlimited maximum difficulty handling
- Password-based difficulty suggestion for clients without mining.suggest_difficulty support
- New work generation on block changes incorporate full wojakcoind transaction set without delay
- Stratum messaging system to running clients
- Accurate pool and per-client statistics with user agent tracking
- Multiple named instances can run concurrently on the same machine

# Building

Building ckpool-lhr-wjk requires basic build tools and yasm on any Linux installation. ZMQ notification support (recommended) requires the zmq devel library installed.

### Building with ZMQ (recommended)

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential yasm libzmq3-dev
./configure
make
```

### Basic build (without ZMQ)

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential yasm
./configure
make
```

### Building from git

Requires additional autotools:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Z3r0XG/ckpool-lhr-wjk.git
cd ckpool-lhr-wjk
sudo apt-get install build-essential yasm autoconf automake libtool libzmq3-dev pkgconf
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
```

### Binaries

Binaries will be built in the `src/` subdirectory:

- **ckpool** - The main pool backend
- **ckpmsg** - Application for passing messages to ckpool
- **notifier** - Application for wojakcoind's `-blocknotify` to notify ckpool of block changes

### Installation

Installation is **not required** and ckpool can be run directly from the build directory, but it can be installed system-wide with:

```bash
sudo make install
```

### Running tests

`libcmocka-dev` is required to run the unit test suite:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libcmocka-dev
make check
```

# Solo Mode

## Use Case

Solo mode allows miners to mine directly to their own WJK address without
pooling with others. Each miner specifies their WJK address as their
username, and any blocks found are paid directly to that address.

**Ideal for:**
- Local solo mining operations
- Miners who want direct block rewards
- Testing and development
- Lottery-style mining to personal addresses

## How Solo Mode Works

In solo mode, ckpool-lhr-wjk connects to a Wojak Coin daemon (wojakcoind) to receive
block templates. Miners connect and provide their WJK address as their
username. When a block is found, the reward goes directly to the miner's
specified address.

**Workflow**: Wojakcoind provides block template → Pool generates work → Miner
connects with WJK address as username → Miner submits shares → Block found →
Reward sent directly to miner's address.

## Quick Start

> This software requires a Wojak Coin (WJK) node running. Tested with [WojakCore](https://github.com/wojakcore/wojakcore) v1.12.1.

#### 1. Configure Wojak Coin Daemon

Edit `bitcoin.conf` (wojakcoind's config file) to enable RPC:
```
server=1
rpcuser=username
rpcpassword=password
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcbind=127.0.0.1
```

Enable ZMQ block notifications (recommended):
```
zmqpubhashblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28340
```

Or use the notifier script as an alternative:
```
blocknotify=/path/to/ckpool/src/notifier
```

#### 2. Create Configuration File

Copy the example and customize:
```bash
cp ckpool.conf.example ckpool.conf
```

Edit `ckpool.conf` with required settings:
```json
{
"btcd" : [
    {
        "url" : "127.0.0.1:20760",
        "auth" : "username",
        "pass" : "password",
        "notify" : true
    }
],
"logdir" : "logs"
}
```

#### 3. Start ckpool-lhr-wjk in Solo Mode

```bash
src/ckpool -B
```

#### 4. Configure Your Miners

Point mining hardware to the pool:
- **URL**: `192.168.1.100:3333` (pool IP address, default port 3333)
- **Username**: Your WJK address, optionally with a worker name (e.g., `WYourWJKaddress.worker1`)
- **Password**: `x, diff=200`
    - `x` - Default password (any value accepted)
    - `diff=X` - Suggest difficulty where `X` is numeric (e.g., `diff=200` or `diff=0.001`).

Any valid WJK address works as the username. WJK mainnet addresses start with `W`. Append `.workername` to track multiple miners separately.

## Configuration Options

All configuration options are listed below.

**"btcd"** : Wojakcoind connection configuration. **REQUIRED**
- Type: Array of objects
- Purpose: Each object defines a wojakcoind instance connection
- Object fields:
  - **"url"** (string, required): Wojakcoind RPC endpoint (IP:port or hostname:port)
  - **"auth"** (string, required): RPC username for authentication
  - **"pass"** (string, required): RPC password for authentication
  - **"cookie"** (string, optional): Path to wojakcoind cookie file (alternative to auth/pass)
  - **"notify"** (boolean, optional): Enable block template notifications from this node
- Default: localhost:20760 with user "user" and password "pass" if not specified
- Note: Cookie-based authentication can be used as an alternative to auth/pass by
  specifying the cookie file path. Multiple wojakcoind instances can be configured for redundancy.
- Example:
```json
"btcd" : [
    {
        "url" : "127.0.0.1:20760",
        "auth" : "username",

**"donation"** : Percentage of block reward to donate. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: Double
- Values: 0.0 to 99.9

- Type: String
- Values: Up to 38 bytes
- Default: None
- Example: `"btcsig" : "/solo mined/"`

- To check: `echo -n "<sig>" | wc -c` (bytes)

**"serverurl"** : Server bindings for miner connections. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: Array of strings
- Values: "IP:port" or "hostname:port"
- Default: All interfaces on port 3333
- Note: Ports below 1024 usually require privileged access
- Example: `"serverurl" : ["192.168.1.100:3333", "127.0.0.1:3333"]`

**"mindiff"** : Minimum difficulty for vardiff. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: Double
- Values: Any positive number
- Default: 1

**"highdiff"** : Starting difficulty for designated high-diff server ports. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: Double
- Values: Any positive number
- Default: 1000000
- Note: Automatically applied to any port > 4000 in `serverurl`.
- Note: Clamped at `mindiff` and `maxdiff`.
- Example: `"highdiff" : 10000`

**"allow_low_diff"** : Remove minimum network difficulty floor (for regtest). **OPTIONAL**
- Type: Boolean
- Default: false
- Note: Enables block submission to blockchains with sub-1.0 network difficulty (e.g., regtest).

- Type: String
- Values: ZMQ URL format
- Default: "tcp://127.0.0.1:28340"

## Notes

> [!NOTE]
> **Difficulty rounding:** `mindiff`, `startdiff`, `maxdiff`, and `highdiff` values >= 1 are rounded to whole numbers. Values below 1 retain full precision.

> [!WARNING]
> JSON is strict with formatting. Do not put a comma after the last field.

> [!NOTE]
> You can mine with a pruned blockchain, though it may add latency.

## Other Modes

ckpool-lhr-wjk is optimized and documented for solo mining. Although it inherits all capabilities from upstream CKPool, other modes are untested and therefore unsupported.

For documentation on pool, proxy, and passthrough modes, please refer to the [original CKPool documentation](https://bitbucket.org/ckolivas/ckpool).
